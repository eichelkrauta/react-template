# Example React App

This project was originally bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Guiding Principles

### 1. Automation > manual tasks
> Todo write stuff here
### 2. Testing should be at multiple layers, not flakey, and maintainable
> Todo write stuff here
### 3. Prefer slimmer set of dependencies where reasonable
> Todo write stuff here

## Todo Repo
* Add e2e testing w/ playwright
* Documentation folder for drawing out pictures
* Example of using react contexts for storage
